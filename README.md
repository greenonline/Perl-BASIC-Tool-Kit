# Perl-BASIC-Tool-Kit
A toolkit for BASIC written in Perl

---

Do you remember the cassettes that you could buy from the back of 8-bit magazines that offered a number of useful tools to aid coding? From seedly looking ads such as this (taken from *Your Computer*, March 1983) :

These toolkits-on-cassette typically included a renumber program and other tools, that extended the native BASIC. Well, this is that, but wrriten in Perl, to run on modern systems. 

Most 8-bit coding is now done on a 'real' computer runnning Linux or OSX, which is then transferred to either an emulator or real machine – very little code is "developed" on the actual 8-bit machines now, just because the native editors and tools (and screen size) are just too limited (there is no point in deliberately typing one hand behind your back). Realising this, it seemed expedient to offer the same useful BASIC tools that came on those cassette tapes, but for text-processing on the newer host OSes.
